For this project, we intend to create a interactive web application that shall allow users associated with
a college or university to generate and view ratings and reviews of local businesses.

If you want to start with businesses in you area:

in your remote directory:

in db/seeds.rb, change the variables lat and long to equal your actual coordinates. it is orginally hard coded with a latitude & longitude around Binghamton Univerity

On local server:

between bundle exec rake db:migrate and rails s -p $PORT -b $IP

do $: bundle exec rake db:seed

So that the sequence of commands is:

bundle exec rake db:seed

rails server -b $IP -p $PORT

On Heroku:
